=method configure

Internal L<IO::Async::Notifier> configuration method. Handles initialization
of C<kube>, C<resource>, C<namespace>, C<timeout>, C<label_selector>,
C<field_selector>, C<names>, C<event_types>, C<reconnect_delay>,
C<max_reconnect_delay>, C<reconnect_jitter>, C<max_retries>,
C<min_watch_duration>, and all event callbacks (C<on_added>, C<on_modified>,
C<on_deleted>, C<on_error>, C<on_event>). Croaks on a C<reconnect_delay>,
C<max_reconnect_delay> or C<min_watch_duration> that is not a non-negative
number, on a C<reconnect_jitter> that is not a number from 0 to 1, and on a
C<max_retries> that is neither a non-negative integer nor C<undef>.

=cut

# Accessors
sub kube           { $_[0]->{kube} }

=method kube

Returns the parent L<Net::Async::Kubernetes> instance.

=cut

sub resource       { $_[0]->{resource} }

=attr resource

Required. The Kubernetes resource kind to watch (e.g., C<'Pod'>,
C<'Deployment'>), or a qualified C<'group/version/Kind'> name to watch a
specific API version -- see L<Net::Async::Kubernetes/expand_class>.

=cut

sub namespace      { $_[0]->{namespace} }

=attr namespace

Optional. Namespace to watch. Omit for cluster-scoped resources or to
watch all namespaces.

=cut

sub timeout        { $_[0]->{timeout} // 300 }

=attr timeout

Server-side timeout per watch cycle in seconds. Default: 300.

=cut

sub reconnect_delay     { $_[0]->{reconnect_delay} // 1 }

=attr reconnect_delay

Seconds to wait before reconnecting after a failed watch attempt (see
L</on_error> for what counts as one). Default: 1. Each further consecutive
failure doubles the delay, up to L</max_reconnect_delay>, and every delay is
shortened at random by up to L</reconnect_jitter>. A reconnect that
gets through -- an event arrives on the stream (an C<ERROR> event does not
count), or the watch cycle ends cleanly -- starts the next failure at
C<reconnect_delay> again. A watch cycle that ends cleanly (the server-side
L</timeout>) is not a failure and reconnects at once; one that closes within
L</min_watch_duration> without an event, or right after an C<ERROR> event,
did not end cleanly.

=cut

sub max_reconnect_delay { $_[0]->{max_reconnect_delay} // 30 }

=attr max_reconnect_delay

Upper bound in seconds for the reconnect delay. Default: 30, the same cap
client-go's reflector puts on its watch backoff: a cluster that comes back is
noticed within half a minute, and one that stays away costs one request and
one report per half minute.

=cut

sub reconnect_jitter    { $_[0]->{reconnect_jitter} // 0.2 }

=attr reconnect_jitter

The share, from 0 to 1, by which each reconnect delay is shortened at random.
Default: 0.2 -- a delay of 4 seconds becomes one between 3.2 and 4 seconds,
rounded to the millisecond. Without it, watchers that fail together (every
watch of a process, or of a fleet, on an API server that restarts) would
send their reconnects together again on every step of the backoff.

The delay is only ever shortened: L</reconnect_delay> and
L</max_reconnect_delay> stay upper bounds, and C<retryAfterSeconds> in the
report (see L</on_error>) is the delay the watcher actually waits. With the
default each step of the backoff still lies above the one before it
(0.8 times double the delay is more than the delay). C<0> turns jitter off,
for delays that are exactly the documented ones.

=cut

sub max_retries         { $_[0]->{max_retries} }

=attr max_retries

How many consecutive failed watch requests are retried before the watcher
gives up. Default: C<undef>, retry for as long as the watcher runs. When the
limit is exceeded the watcher stops and reports that it gave up (see
L</on_error>); C<start()> begins again with the full count. C<0> gives up on
the first failure.

=cut

sub min_watch_duration  { $_[0]->{min_watch_duration} // 1 }

=attr min_watch_duration

Seconds a watch stream has to stay open before it may end without an event.
Default: 1. A stream that closes sooner without delivering a single event is
no watch cycle that ran its course but a failed attempt (see L</on_error>):
reconnecting at once would send the API server one watch request after
another in a tight loop -- a proxy or API server that accepts the watch and
closes it straight away. The default is the threshold client-go's reflector
uses for the same case (a "very short watch"): a real watch cycle runs until
the server-side L</timeout>, minutes, so one second tells the two apart with
room for a slow connection. C<0> turns the check off.

=cut

sub label_selector { $_[0]->{label_selector} }

=attr label_selector

Optional label selector (e.g., C<'app=web,env=prod'>).

=cut

sub field_selector { $_[0]->{field_selector} }

=attr field_selector

Optional field selector (e.g., C<'status.phase=Running'>).

=cut

sub names          { $_[0]->{names} }

=attr names

Optional client-side filter for resource names. Accepts a single regex,
a string (exact match), or an arrayref of regexes/strings. Events whose
resource name does not match any of the patterns are silently dropped
before callbacks fire.

    # Single regex
    names => qr/^nginx/

    # Multiple patterns (any match passes)
    names => [qr/^nginx/, qr/^redis/]

    # Exact string match
    names => 'my-pod'

=cut

sub event_types    { $_[0]->{event_types} }

=attr event_types

Optional client-side filter for event types. Accepts an arrayref of
type strings (C<ADDED>, C<MODIFIED>, C<DELETED>, C<ERROR>). Events
whose type is not in the list are silently dropped.

    # Only ADDED and DELETED events
    event_types => ['ADDED', 'DELETED']

When not set, event types are automatically derived from which callbacks
are registered. If only C<on_added> is set, only C<ADDED> events are
dispatched. If C<on_event> is set (catch-all), all types pass through.

=cut

sub on_added       { $_[0]->{on_added} }

=attr on_added

Callback for ADDED events. Receives the inflated IO::K8s object.

=cut

sub on_modified    { $_[0]->{on_modified} }

=attr on_modified

Callback for MODIFIED events. Receives the inflated IO::K8s object.

=cut

sub on_deleted     { $_[0]->{on_deleted} }

=attr on_deleted

Callback for DELETED events. Receives the inflated IO::K8s object.

=cut

sub on_error       { $_[0]->{on_error} }

=attr on_error

Callback for errors of the watch. Receives a hashref shaped like a Kubernetes
C<Status>, in two cases:

=over 4

=item * An C<ERROR> event on the stream, for example a C<403> arriving
mid-stream: the raw C<Status> hashref the API server sent. C<410 Gone> is
handled internally and never reaches it.

=item * A failed watch attempt: the request fails outright (TLS support
missing, a TLS or connection error, an unreachable API server), the API
server rejects it with an HTTP error status (C<401>, C<403>, C<5xx>), or the
stream it opens ends badly -- within L</min_watch_duration> without a single
event, or right after an C<ERROR> event other than C<410 Gone> (that event
is reported first, as above). The watcher builds this C<Status> itself.
C<reason> is C<WatchFailed>, C<code> the HTTP status of a rejected request,
the C<code> of the C<ERROR> event the stream ended on, or C<0> when neither
is there (no response arrived, or the stream closed without an event),
C<message> names the resource, what the watcher does next and the cause, and
C<details> carries C<kind> (the watched resource) and, while the watcher
retries, C<retryAfterSeconds>:

    {
        kind       => 'Status',
        apiVersion => 'v1',
        status     => 'Failure',
        reason     => 'WatchFailed',
        code       => 0,
        message    => 'watch Pod failed, retrying in 4s: Connection refused',
        details    => { kind => 'Pod', retryAfterSeconds => 4 },
    }

Once L</max_retries> is exceeded, the message says C<giving up after N
retries> instead and C<retryAfterSeconds> is absent; the watcher has
stopped by then.

=back

A failed watch attempt is reported whatever L</event_types> says. Without an
C<on_error> it is passed to C<warn> instead, so a watch that cannot reach its
cluster never fails silently. C<ERROR> events without an C<on_error> are
dropped, as before. The callback may call C<stop()>, which also cancels the
reconnect just announced.

=cut

sub on_event       { $_[0]->{on_event} }

=attr on_event

Catch-all callback. Receives the L<Kubernetes::REST::WatchEvent> object.
Called in addition to the type-specific callbacks.

=cut

    $self->{_stopped} = 0;
    $self->{_failures} = 0;
    $self->_start_watch;
}

=method start

Start (or restart) the watch stream. Called automatically when the watcher
is added to the event loop. Safe to call multiple times (idempotent): a
watcher waiting to reconnect after a failed request is already running. After
C<stop()>, or after giving up on L</max_retries>, it starts over with the full
retry count.

        }
    }
}

=method stop

Stop the watch stream and cancel the current HTTP request, or a reconnect
that is waiting out its delay. The watcher will not automatically reconnect
until C<start()> is called again.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An L<IO::Async::Notifier> that watches a Kubernetes resource for changes.
Created via L<Net::Async::Kubernetes/watcher>.

The watcher automatically:

=over 4

=item * Reconnects when the server-side timeout expires

=item * Resumes from the last C<resourceVersion> to avoid missing events

=item * Handles 410 Gone by clearing the C<resourceVersion> and restarting

=item * Retries a failed watch attempt -- a transport error, a rejection
such as C<401> or C<403>, or a stream that closes at once without an event
or right after an C<ERROR> event -- with an exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s,
... up to 30s by default, see L</reconnect_delay>, each shortened at random
by up to a fifth, see L</reconnect_jitter>), reports every such
failure to L</on_error> or as a warning, and gives up after L</max_retries>
consecutive failures when a limit is set

=item * Filters events client-side by name patterns (C<names>) and event types (C<event_types>)
